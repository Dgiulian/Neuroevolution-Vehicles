# Neuroevolution steering vehicles

A neural network powered vehicle that drives around a randomly-generated path without hitting the walls.

Uses the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) libraries.
This code was implemented following the Coding challenge [#178](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXDrH0wStHs) of the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) channel.


## To Do
- [X] Add paragraph elements displaying the simulation speed and best car stats
- [ ] Smooth track with OpenSimplexNoise
- [ ] Improve the look of the track and cars
- [ ] Add crossover
- [ ] Add controls for debug features
- [ ] Add control for NN Features
- [ ] Add control for Track Features like
  * difficulty
  * thickness
  * jaggedness
  * height of jaggedness
